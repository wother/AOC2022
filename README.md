# Some kind of readme

seems we all need to do a little coding.

I'm using this year to learn both neovim and deno.

Yeah, TS is a toy language that will never make it and doesn't have support for
some random features, a garbage collector that kills puppies, insulted your mother,
and whatever. I don't care. 

Have a nice day!
